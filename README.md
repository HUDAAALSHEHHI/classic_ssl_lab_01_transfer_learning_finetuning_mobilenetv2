🧠 Comprehensive Explanation of the Experiment
This experiment explores the principles of Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning by applying a pretrained model (MobileNetV2) to a small subset of the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal is to demonstrate how pretrained knowledge can be reused and adapted to new, limited datasets, significantly reducing computational requirements while achieving high accuracy.

✏️ Objective
To implement fine-tuning on a pretrained MobileNetV2 architecture using only 2,000 training images. The objective is to prove that even with minimal data, a pretrained model can learn domain-specific patterns efficiently by reusing prior knowledge rather than starting from scratch.

📒 Results
The fine-tuned model achieved high performance within a few epochs, with accuracy increasing steadily after selectively unfreezing the top layers. The experiment confirmed that gradual fine-tuning enhances generalization and maintains stability in learned features. Visualizing training accuracy curves clearly showed the model’s adaptation to the new dataset without overfitting.

📘 Observations

Transfer learning drastically reduces training time compared to training from scratch.

Layer freezing followed by gradual unfreezing preserves previously learned general features while adapting to new data.

Fine-tuning is sensitive to learning rate and batch size; careful optimization is crucial.

Small datasets benefit from strong data augmentation to improve diversity and prevent overfitting.

The experiment demonstrates how knowledge reuse in deep learning bridges the gap between limited data availability and high model performance.
